This concise volume seeks to address the silent void that university students embarking on mathematical coursework inevitably face:  How does one apply ideas, concepts, and theory to story problems that at first seem intractable?  We pay equal attention to the abstract aspects of problem solving as well as the practical.  We discuss common misperceptions of ability and pay close attention to the attitudes and habits employed by successful problem solvers.  We reveal problem solving as both achievable and fun, and illustrate these themes with specific examples and stories throughout the text.  We also enumerate simple, executable steps that can be implemented when faced with virtually any new problem:  understand the problem; draw a picture; define variables; be consistent; utilize principles.  Far from trivial, these steps often lead novice problem solvers to error.  In sum, we hope you find this charming work to be an indispensable guide on your journey and an effective means to improving and maturing your problem-solving capabilities.
