This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the fields of dynamical systems and geometric mechanics in a single volume.  The exposition is concise and clear, and is supplemented with a number of illuminating examples and exercises.  The text offers an ample amount of flexibility:  core sections from both parts of the text may be reasonably digested in a single-semester introductory graduate-level course, or the text may be covered in more detail over a two-semester course.  The text also discusses several new results that have yet to appear in any other textbook, and each chapter concludes with an application that can serve as a springboard project for further investigation, projects, or in-class discussion.\n\nIn the first part of the text, we discuss linearization and stability of trajectories and fixed points, invariant manifold theory, periodic orbits, Poincaré maps, Floquet theory, the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem, bifurcations, and chaos. The second part of the text begins with a self-contained chapter on differential geometry that introduces notions of manifolds, mappings, vector fields, the Jacobi-Lie bracket, and differential forms. The final chapters cover Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics from a modern geometric perspective, mechanics on Lie groups, and nonholonomic mechanics via both moving frames and fiber bundle decompositions
