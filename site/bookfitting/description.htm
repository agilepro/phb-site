Here's how. First connect with a good conversation.  Make sure you both talk and listen. Your understanding builds compassion and love.
Why this book?  Because your attraction to each other doesn't always insure a connection. So when there's disconnection, you can learn how to reconnect, maintain and strengthen the bond.
Why else? Because your primary relationship is worth some effort so that when you lose your partner you'll  have great memories to sustain you and no regrets to spoil those memories. When your loved one dies, death doesn't win if you have the joy of happy memories.
