Keith Swenson, WfMC Vice Chair says, Regardless of whether you design a fixed definition in advance for a predictable process, or whether a case manager extends the plan for an unpredictable process while working, the results can be analyzed with process intelligence technology. Retrospective analysis can tell us if the processes are going according to plan, and can tell us if the plan itself is a good idea. In cases where work was performed without the guidance of a process, process mining, also known as automatic process discovery, can tell us what the process has actually been without having to involve people in lengthy, and error prone, interviews. Process mining can tell us what is efficient and inefficient about an existing work pattern, and it can give us a jump-start on new BPM implementation efforts when no previous process definition exists.  Business (Process) Intelligence is a field that is just beginning to show very promising results. Eleven independent chapters in this book bring us views of this topic. After all, in the end, it is process analytics that keeps us all honest. Because it can measure performance, Business Process Intelligence is a critical part of delivering on the promise of improving performance of the business.
