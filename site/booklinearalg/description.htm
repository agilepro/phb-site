This text introduces linear algebra -- boiled to its essence -- presented in a clear and concise fashion. Designed around a single-semester undergraduate course, Essential Linear Algebra introduces key concepts, various real-world applications, and provides detailed yet understandable proofs of key results that are aimed towards students with no advanced preparation in proof writing. The level of sophistication gradually increases from beginning to end in order to prepare students for subsequent studies.\nWe begin with a detailed introduction to systems of linear equations and elementary row operations. We then advance to a discussion of linear transformations, which provide a second, more geometric, interpretation of the operation of matrix-vector product. We go on to introduce vector spaces and their subspaces, the image and kernel of a transformation, and change of coordinates. Following, we discuss matrices of orthogonal projections and orthogonal matrices. Our penultimate chapter is devoted to the theory of determinants, which are presented, first, in terms of area and volume expansion factors of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices, respectively. We use a geometric understanding of volume in n-dimensions to introduce general determinants axiomatically as multilinear, antisymmetric mappings, and prove existence and uniqueness. Our final chapter is devoted to the theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We conclude with a number of discussions on various types of diagonalization: real, complex, and orthogonal.
