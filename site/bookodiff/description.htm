<p>This text introduces elementary ordinary differential equations in a clear and concise fashion.  Designed around a single-semester undergraduate course, Ordinary Differential Equations explores key concepts along with various real-world applications.  In particular, we discuss common techniques for solving first-order differential equations, basic numerical methods, second-order homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations, the generalization to higher-order linear differential equations, the Laplace transform method, linear systems of differential equations, and nonlinear systems of differential equations.</p>

<p>The Second Edition contains several new sections, and several new subsections, additional discussion on certain topics, additional exercises, and a number of corrections.  This new edition contains approximately 80 additional pages.</p>
