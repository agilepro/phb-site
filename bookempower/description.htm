Adaptive Case Management allows productivity improvements to be measured in both financial and non-financial terms, including reduced re-work, improved customer, and employee satisfaction. In part, by bringing areas of work previously <i>under the radar</i> when performed in purely ad hoc environments into greater visibility, Adaptive Case Management offers the ability to prioritize activities across multiple cases, balancing workloads, as well as monitoring quality, timeliness and speed. Highly predictable work is easy to support using traditional programming techniques, while unpredictable work cannot be accurately scripted in advance, and thus requires the involvement of the knowledge workers themselves. There is a broad and collaborative synthesis of case data that is at the heart of what makes Adaptive Case Management <i>adaptive</i> and is also the basic driver for why it needs to be so. Adaptive Case Management is ultimately about allowing knowledge workers to work the way that they want to work and to provide them with the tools and information they need to do so effectively. Co-authors of this ground-breaking book include industry experts Keith Swenson, Nathaniel Palmer, Steinar Carlsen, Keith Harrison-Broninski et al
