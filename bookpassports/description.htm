Knowing what your BPM success will look like before you even begin your journey will help you achieve it. So will knowing what are the most common causes of failure. We learn more from failure than success, but it's easier, cheaper and quicker to learn from others' mistakes rather than go through the pain personally. BPM projects fail more often as a result of missed expectations than inadequate technology. In this book you will learn how to create and present a credible business case and plan for success, see particularly the chapter BPM Success Manifesto.  The value of BPM is realized through planning and measurement, and the business case needs to be developed with transparent success criteria and real-world metrics.
