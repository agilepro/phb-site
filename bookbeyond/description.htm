<p>It is time to move beyond the process model. The process model has been viewed in the past as the key for organizations to increase efficiency and effectiveness, however the model has now become the barrier to being able to evolve.  This talk will introduce a radical approach to construct and perform business processes dubbed “Emergent Synthetic Processes” (ESP) where the process model is actually synthesized at run-time from "Service Descriptions. </p>  


<p>This approach will allow processes to change and reform dynamically while at the same time assuring conformance to all parties stated requirements.  Individuals are able to add and remove tasks from the synthesized process without needing to get approval from the other stakeholders.  Service descriptions guarantee conformance to their needs and concerns.</p>  


<p>This approach decentralizes the control of the process, with each role player able to control their part of the process, adapting their part to their changing needs without involving a centralized process designer and without needing stakeholders to agree in advance on the process.   This paradigm will change the way we approach supporting business processes.</p>
