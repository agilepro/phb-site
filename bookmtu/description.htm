The facilitation of knowledge work or what is increasingly known as &quot;Case Management&quot; represents the next imperative in office automation. The desire to fully support <i>knowledge workers</i> within the workplace is not new. What's new is that recent advances in Information Technology now make the management of unpredictable  circumstances a practical reality.
<br> There's now a groundswell of interest in a more flexible, dynamic approach to supporting knowledge work. Here are examples of what recognized experts have have recently written on the topic:&#xA0;
<br> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Advancing to support more knowledge work is the goal of many organizations,&#xA0;
<br> <i>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;thus there is a new groundswell of activity around unstructured processes.&#xA0;</i>
<br> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;- Jim Sinur, VP of Research, Gartner
<br> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;I think a sea change is coming in the process world.&#xA0;
<br> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;-Connie Moore, Research Vice President, Forrester&#xA0;
<br> The sea of change Moore refers to is about technology that is able to support knowledge workers. The work of a knowledge worker is by its nature unpredictable and can not be handled by more formalized process definition techniques.&#xA0;
<br> For executives and managers of knowledge workers, &quot;Mastering the Unpredictable&quot; will:&#xA0;
<br> <ul><li> Explain the need and why previous technological approaches don't meet the need&#xA0;</li> <li> Explain the current technology gap, and the new technology that can close the gap&#xA0;</li> <li> Lay out the options that can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their organizations&#xA0;</li> <li> Equip them to best take advantage of this evolving trend</li></ul>

For executives and managers of knowledge workers, Mastering the Unpredictable explains why previous trends don’t meet the needs of knowledge workers, how new technology that is coming will fill the gap, and equips them to best take advantage of this evolving trend. The work of a knowledge worker is by its nature unpredictable and can not be handled by more formalized process definition techniques. Peter F Drucker has said "Knowledge worker productivity is the biggest of the 21st century management challenges. In the developed countries it is their first survival requirement." The facilitation of the knowledge workers and knowledge work, what is increasingly known as Case Management, represents the next imperative in office automation. Jim Sinur says "Advancing to support more knowledge work is the goal of many organizations". Connie Moore claims: "a sea change is coming in the process world." Be prepared, the benefits will be to those agile and quick enough to take advantage of this new situation.
